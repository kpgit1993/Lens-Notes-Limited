			<h2>Company's Background</h2>
			<p>
				We are a group of professional organised people who are actively working in our new startup. We are strategically building and self-innovating to materialize advertisement ideas that can promote a brand over a wide range of people in the society in the most economic environment friendly way. In layman words, we monitize spces in notebooks for delivering advertisements.<br><br>
				
				As per studies, a person in a typical day spends 10-15 minutes in reading newspapers, 2 hours in watching TV. Given that TV ads, newspaper/magazine ads have short shelf life and less precision of target audience, . The big hoardings, banners involves high rental investments. In addition investors needs to seek approvals from the government body to set the hoardings. Though, the internet brings an easy mean of ads (e.g: Google ad, facebook ads) these are costly. People use some plugin programs on the browsers to get rid of irrelevant advertisements. <br><br>
				
				So what is the way to reach majority of the common people avoiding all these troublesome hurdles in an economic way? 
				We have found just the right solution for this. Our idea is to post print ads on notebook covers in attractive and colourful way.
